A text editor allows you to write and manage text that you use to build your website. You can download and install a text editor, or use one from a web browser.

### The most important features to look for in a text editor:
1. code completion (suggestions of how to finish your code)

2. syntax highlighting (takes your text and changes the color based on the item to make it easier to read.)

3. a nice variety of themes (pretty straightforward, you can change background color, etc. typically developers use a dark background as it's easier on the eyes).
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them (basically allowing plugins)


If you use the basic text eitor that comes with your computer it will only show things in plain text and not provide the bells and whistles that third party text editors can provide as mentioned above.

I liked the example the readings gave comparing IDEs to outlook. IDEs can do a lot of things, including edit text, file manager, compiler, and a debugger in one.


The command line is basically the written text telling the computer what to do.
