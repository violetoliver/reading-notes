Comparison of “basic” text editor vs coding-specific text editor vs IDE.


A text editor allows you to write and manage text that you use to build your website. You can download and install a text editor, or use one from a web browser.

The most important features to look for in a text editor:
1. code completion (suggestions of how to finish your code)

2. syntax highlighting (takes your text and changes the color based on the item to make it easier to read.)

3. a nice variety of themes (pretty straightforward, you can change background color, etc. typically developers use a dark background as it's easier on the eyes).
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them (basically allowing plugins)
