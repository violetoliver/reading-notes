A text editor allows you to write and manage text that you use to build your website. You can download and install a text editor, or use one from a web browser.

### The most important features to look for in a text editor:
1. code completion (suggestions of how to finish your code)

2. syntax highlighting (takes your text and changes the color based on the item to make it easier to read.)

3. a nice variety of themes (pretty straightforward, you can change background color, etc. typically developers use a dark background as it's easier on the eyes).
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them (basically allowing plugins)


If you use the basic text eitor that comes with your computer it will only show things in plain text and not provide the bells and whistles that third party text editors can provide as mentioned above.

I liked the example the readings gave comparing IDEs to outlook. IDEs can do a lot of things, including edit text, file manager, compiler, and a debugger in one.


_**What is Linux?**_ 
An operating system. Everything is a file. It's case sensitive.

The command line is basically the written text telling the computer what to do. Or, A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.


**Commands**
* PWD (Print Working Directory) - to understand where we are
* Ls (List)
* [] [option]
* cd (change directory) - move to another directory. You must run it with an argument []
* Quotes - anything in quotes is considered one item. This is a good way to get aroundspaces.
* backslash/escape character

### Shortcuts
* Using the up and down aarows in terminal, you can review previous commands that you ran because all commands are stored.

* Tab Completion: When you start typing a path (anywhere on the command line, you're not just limited to certain commands) you may hit the Tab key on your keyboard at any time which will invoke an auto complete action.

### Paths
A Path is a way to get to certain file or directory in an operating system. There are two types of paths: abosulte or relative. Both will take you to the same location.

To begin with, we have to understand that the file system under linux is a hierarchical structure. At the very top of the structure is what's called the root directory. A path is a means to get to a particular location in the system and that location is a file.

**Absolute paths** specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )

**Relative paths** specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.

**~ (tilde)** This is a shortcut for your home directory.

**. (dot)** This is a reference to your current directory.

**.. (dotdot)** This is a reference to the parent directory.

### Hidden files and directories. If the file starts with a "." than it's hidden.
