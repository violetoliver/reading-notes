### Growth Mindset

**Growth mindset is where you are constantly pushing yourself to grow and evolve. You are open and flexible to feedback and are constantly learning.**
How to stay in a growth mindset
* Positive reinforcement. Continue to remind myself that I can learn new and challenging things.
* Remain open.
* In order to accomplish things that you've never accomplished, you must do things that you've never done before.
